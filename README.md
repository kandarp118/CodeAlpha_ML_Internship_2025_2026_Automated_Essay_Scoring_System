## 🎓 Internship Details
* **Organization:** CodeAlpha
* **Role:** Machine Learning Intern
* **Student ID:** CA/SE3/4912
* **Duration:** 5th October 2025 – 5th January 2026
* **Status:** Completed ✅

---

## 🚀 Project Objective
The goal of this task was to build a machine learning model to automatically score essays based on four critical pillars:
* **Content Relevance**: Measuring alignment with the prompt topic using **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Cosine Similarity**.
* **Grammar & Spelling**: Detecting structural errors and capitalization issues using **NLTK**.
* **Coherence & Structure**: Analyzing sentence length and logical flow through **Feature Engineering**.
* **Vocabulary Richness**: Evaluating lexical diversity and sophisticated word usage.

## 🔍 NLP Pipeline & Workflow



The system processes text through a structured pipeline to ensure accurate evaluation:
1. **Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization using NLTK.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Utilizing TF-IDF to represent text numerically.
3. **Similarity Analysis**: Comparing essay content against reference topics.
4. **Scoring Engine**: Applying logic to calculate a final weighted score out of 10.
